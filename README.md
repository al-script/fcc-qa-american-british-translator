# fcc-qa-american-british-translator
 
This is a public copy of my [American / British Translator](https://fcc-qa-american-british-trlr-47023733fdca.herokuapp.com/) project. This repo serves a dual-purpose to: 1. fulfill the freeCodeCamp certificate requirement for publicly available source code, and 2. deploy the project to Heroku. This project was originally built and hosted on Replit, but is no longer deployed on that platform due to changes to Replitâ€™s free tier.
